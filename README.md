# Solana_Hackathon_WIP
This Project is being created with LOVE, for the EnCode x Soloana Hackathon

Still Needs:
Integrated GameToken contract functions STARTGAME.
Integrated P2E contract functions startGame, playerWon, playerLost.
startGame, playerWon, playerLost feedback is reflected (shown) in UX/UI .. player token balance changes shown on screen, not just in a MetaMask pop-up
Re-factor redux integration.
better handle user's failure to sign in.
